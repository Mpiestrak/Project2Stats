# Project 2: Soccer Stat Tracker
___

##Overview
 For Project 2 I created an app that allows the user to create and maintain soccer leagues.  When users reach the site they will have the options of either creating a new league or accessing one that is currently running.  Once they select a league they will see a page containing the teams information including their current stats.
